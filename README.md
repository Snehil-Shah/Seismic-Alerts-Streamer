<h3 id="about-the-project">• About The Project</h3>

**Seismic Alerts Streamer** at its core, uses Kafka to listen & collect data of Realtime Global Seismic events from Producers and streams them to Consumers.

<img src="assets/architecture.png" alt="Architecture diagram for this microservice" />

All Producers are managed via a Python interface.
**Producers** consists of:
1. A [WebSocket endpoint](https://www.seismicportal.eu/) by European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC).
2. A Flask Rest API that allows a user to **Report any Seismic Activity around them** or Fetch log archives from the Database.

These events are then published to two Kafka topics namely ```minor_seismic_events``` & ```severe_seismic_events``` based on their magnitude.

**Consumers** connected to the Kafka broker, subscribe to these topics and start receiving Seismic Logs. All the consumers are managed via a Multi-threaded Java interface as clients.
Consumers consists of:
1. A Java SMTP client reads from ```severe_seismic_events``` and Alerts the user of potentially Dangerous Seismic Activity via Email
2. A Live Log Feed that reads from both topics allowing the user to conveniently view a **Realtime feed of all Seismic Activity around the world**
3. A Postgres Database connected directly via a Kafka-JDBC Sink Connector (initialized by the Java interface) conveniently maintains an archive of all Seismic Activity recorded through Kafka.



<h3 id="future-prospects">• Future Prospects</h3>
The overall <b>Goal</b> of the project is to build a portable, efficient and scalable system that can connect various Seismology Providers to various Consumer clients that can serve the users in innovative ways keeping them safe and alerted.

 <img src="assets/feature.jpg" />

Apache Kafka because of its high through-put enables it to scale easily to huge traffic using many brokers & clusters. The Service is further fully Containerized making it ready for deployment.



<h3 id="tech-used">• Technologies Used</h3>

The Project is developed using the following Technologies, Libraries & Frameworks:

- Kafka & Kafka-connect (Confluent)
- Docker
- Python
- Java & Maven
- Tornado
- Flask
- PostgreSQL
- JavaMail API (SMTP)
- Shell

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

<h3 id="getting-started">• Getting Started</h3>

To setup the project locally follow the steps below

- <h4 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites:</h4>

  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) : Told you.. Its fully Containerized!

- <h4 id="running-the-project">Running the Project:</h4>
  
  - <h4>As a User</h4>
  
  1. **Fork** and **clone** the project to your local system
  2. Set necessary environment variables. Create a ```.env``` file in the ```/Consumers``` directory and write your Gmail credentials in it for the Gmail SMTP client. This email will be used to send the Alerts to the users.
  Name them as:
  ```
  SERVICE_EMAIL_ID=john.doe@gmail.com
  SERVICE_EMAIL_PASSWORD=password
  ```
  If you have 2-step Authentication set up for your Google Account, [Create a new app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?visit_id=638381954978806969-3472662555&p=InvalidSecondFactor&rd=1) and use that password in your .env file

  <br>

  3. Now build and run the docker-compose file & ```exec -it``` into the ```consumers``` container.
  To do this, from project directory, run

  ```shell
  docker compose up -d --build   # Build & run the containers
  docker exec -it <containerId_of_consumers> sh   # Attach shell to consumers container
  ``` 

  This should run the following containers

<img src="assets/containers.png">

To find the <container_id>, run ```docker ps``` or use Docker Desktop, and copy the container id of container named ```consumers``` or ```seismic-alerts-streamer-consumers```

  <br>

  iv. Once inside the ```consumers``` container's shell, run


  ```shell
  mvn -q exec:java   # Run the maven project
  ``` 
  You have **successfully** entered the program as a user!

  - <h4>Usage of the Rest API</h4>

      The Rest API accessible at ```localhost:5000``` has the following endpoints:
  1. ```POST /seismic_events```: Self-Report Seismic Activity in you region
   
   Request Body should adhere to the given format for a successful submission:
   ```json
   {
    "magnitude":"float",
    "region":"string",
    "time":"ISO-8601 string. Min: YYYY, Max: YYYY-MM-DD(T)hh:mm:ss.ssssss(Zone)",
    "co_ordinates":"array of floats"
   }                                 
   ```

  <img src="assets/sending_post.png">



  2. ```GET /seismic_events```: Returns entire recorded archive from Database.
   
  <img src="assets/sending_get.png">

  3. ```GET /seismic_events/minor``` or ```GET seismic_events/severe```: Returns records based on severity of the Seismic activities.

- <h4>For Developers</h4>
  All micro-services are set up with meaningful logs that can help with debugging and further development.
  To view log of other containers, run

  ```shell
  docker logs <container_id>
  ```
  If you wish to develop it locally without docker, manually install the [technologies used](#tech-used).
  Run the following commands to install necessary dependencies:
  ```bash
  cd Producers
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  ```bash
  cd Consumers
  mvn clean install
  ```
